Micspam
=======

A WinForms app to play sounds. Use [Virtual Audio Cable](http://software.muzychenko.net/eng/vac.htm) for micspamming.
Basically it's a music player that can play multiple sounds and output to multiple devices at the same time.

The app uses [CSCore](http://cscore.codeplex.com/) audio library for sound output.

Supported formats
-----------------
* MP3 (.mp3)
* Waveform (.wav)

The following formats are a big maybe. The app should be able to load these but they may not work properly.
* All AAC formats (such as .mp4, .m4a, .aac)
* FLAC
